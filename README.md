## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```

### 2. Start the server

npm run dev
```

The server will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

- Click an image to view details in a modal.
- Use the "Switch Theme" button to toggle between light and dark (Mocha) themes.
- Click "View Dashboard" to see image/theme click analytics.

### 4. Uploading Images

- Use the upload form on the main page to add images (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`).
- Uploaded files are saved in the `outputs` directory.

### 5. Customizing Themes

- Theme names are extracted from filenames (e.g., `wallpaper_tokyo-storm.jpg` â†’ theme: `tokyo-storm`).
- Pixelated images should include `_pixelate` in the filename for proper filtering.

### 6. Batch Processing (Optional)
